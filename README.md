## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) - using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).(or just command below)

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

Then generate your new project:

1) download this package 

```bash
npm i -g generator-react-flux-generator
```

2) create somewhere new empty folder

```bash
mkdir new_project
```

3) navigate to that new folder

```bash
cd new_project
```

4)  run
```bash
yo react-flux-generator
```

That's all!
After install you will have the new clear project with webpack,post.css etc. plugins.

5) launch your generated project

```bash
npm run dev
```
